                    Lokoja, the capital of Kogi State, Nigeria, is home to several vibrant and culturally significant
                    markets, including Kpata Market, New Market (International Market), and the Old Market. These
                    markets are essential to the local economy, attracting traders and buyers from surrounding towns and
                    even neighboring states.

                    One of the most unique features of the Lokoja market system is its 5-day interval market cycle. This
                    traditional trading pattern allows market days to rotate every five days rather than sticking to
                    specific weekdays. As a result, locals plan their shopping and trading activities around these
                    intervals.

                    The Lokoja market is bustling with various goods ranging from fresh produce, foodstuffs, clothing,
                    household items, electronics, and more. On market days, the city becomes even more lively, with
                    increased transportation, vendor activity, and community interaction.
